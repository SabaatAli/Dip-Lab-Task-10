# Dip-Lab-Task-10
This project implements a JPEG-like image compression system using Python in Google Colab. The script compresses a color image by processing each RGB channel independently using block-based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and inverse DCT. The effect of compression is analyzed both visually and numerically.
